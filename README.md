nuCAPTCHA
================================

Use the local branch to run locally. Otherwise check out nucaptcha.us:5000

On a linux machine, running scripts/nc_setup.sh will do everything for you.
Otherwise, run the following commands.

Feel free to install virtualenv and create and source a virtual environment
before doing these things.
* pip install -r requirements.txt
* cd wtforms-json-master; python setup.py install
* cd ..
* python nucaptcha.py
